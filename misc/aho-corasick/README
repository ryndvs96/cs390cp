# Aho-Corasick Automaton

Primarily based on [these notes](http://www.cs.uku.fi/~kilpelai/BSA05/lectures/slides04.pdf).

Given a set of words (the dictionary) and an alphabet (sigma), this produces an automaton used to match any word in the dictionary against an input string. Each character in the input string must be in the alphabet.
